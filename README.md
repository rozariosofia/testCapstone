# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX

## Executive Summary

The commercial space industry is making space travel more affordable and accessible, with companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and especially SpaceX leading the way. SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, has achieved significant milestones, including sending spacecraft to the International Space Station, deploying the Starlink satellite constellation, and launching manned missions to space.
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket is notably cost-effective, at $62 million per launch compared to $165 million for other providers, due to its reusable first stage. Predicting the success of the first stage landing is crucial for determining launch costs and competing effectively.


## Introduction

In this capstone project, my goal is to predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing. SpaceX's ability to reuse this stage significantly reduces launch costs. Accurately predicting the landing success will help determine launch costs and enable competitors to make informed bids.

## Requirements

If we can accurately predict the likelihood of the Falcon 9 first stage landing successfully, we can better estimate launch costs. This insight is vital for the new rocket company, Space Y, to compete with SpaceX by making informed bids for rocket launches. 

## Objective

### Predictive Modeling: 
- Use data science and machine learning to predict the likelihood of successful first stage landings, thus determining launch costs.
### Data Exploration: 
- Gain insights from data analysis.


## Scope

As a data scientist for Space Y, I will:
- Collect Data: Gather information on SpaceX rocket landing missions.
- Analyze Data: Apply data science techniques to understand landing success factors.
- Predict Outcomes: Use machine learning to predict first stage landing success.


## Deliverables
- Predictive Algorithms: Develop accurate models to forecast rocket landing outcomes.
- Business Report: Provide stakeholders with a detailed report on findings, methodologies, and strategic recommendations.
